Super Tic-Tac-Toe
Super Tic-Tac-Toe is an enhanced and interactive version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using the Raylib library in C. The game offers both single-player (against AI) and multiplayer modes, providing an engaging experience with sound effects, a modern user interface, and responsive gameplay.

Features
Single-Player Mode: Compete against a simple AI that makes random moves to challenge your strategic skills.
Multiplayer Mode: Play with a friend locally on the same device.
Intuitive User Interface: Easy-to-use menu for selecting game modes.
Sound Effects: Adds excitement to gameplay with sounds for marking moves and winning.
Grid Display: Real-time updates of the grid with clear visual distinction for 'X' and 'O'.
Winning Logic: Identifies the winner or declares a tie when the grid is full.
How to Play
Start the Game:

On launching, the menu appears with two options: Single Player and Multiplayer.
Select your preferred mode using the mouse.
Gameplay:

Single Player: You play as X while the AI plays as O.
Multiplayer: Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns.
Click on an empty cell to make your move.
Winning Conditions:

The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If the grid fills up without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
Restart:

Once the game ends, press R to return to the menu.
